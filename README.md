Please go back and try to solve by yourself for the love of math, programming and science in general or go to the gitter chat room of this repository and ask anything that you have trouble with. Any contributions are welcome.
I don't want to push you to copy the answers.
I want to show how I did it and maybe you will compare with your's.
Good Luck and Have Fun!

Thanks!
