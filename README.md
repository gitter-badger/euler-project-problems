From Problem 2 Because the problem 1 was too easy :cake:
<br><br>
Please go back and try to solve by yourself for the love of math, programming and science in general.
I don't want to push you to copy the answers.
I want to show how I did it and maybe you will compare with your's.
Good Luck and Have Fun!
<br>
Thanks!
